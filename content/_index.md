# Hey There!

This is a collection of coding tutorials and write-ups put together by me. I'm not special (I suck at coding after all :P) and I believe that if I can do this then you can too!

Here we're going to be primarily focused on Dear PyGui and creating small apps with it. Generally there are two types of write-ups that will exist:
* General Approaches
* Specific Solutions

## General Approaches

These look to showcase an overall approach used to solve a toy problem with the intent that you can take the ideas and apply them to your own work. By nature of being toy problems they will likely look a ton cleaner than real-world code.

## Specific Solutions

These solve specific and weird problems! Sometimes the approach in general is interesting but not generalizable or has no toy problem that isn't extremely contrived. I'll try to point out lessons and point out the re-usable pieces but I can only guarantee they solve the problem they solve.

**Note!**  
You don't -need- any of this! These are things I find useful but feel free to discard what is uninteresting or impractical for you and take what works! At the end of the day what matters is what works for you and nothing else!

### Automate The Boring Stuff

Early on in your coding adventures, unsure what to code? Check out [Automate The Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) for real-world and directly useful python that can make your life easier. A lot of the ideas and inspiration you can draw from there can be made even more powerful by wrapping in a GUI app. 

### Talk Python To Me

A great podcast about python, his two panel episodes on [Beginners and Experts - Part 1](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/203/beginners-and-experts-in-software-development) [and Part 2](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/205/beginners-and-experts-panel) were pretty critical for me to hear while trying to break into coding. I also used a few of his courses as part of the foundation of learning to code in python and they were great for me!

### Social Stuff

The DPG discord is super wonderful and full of fun people! The support channel is wonderful and responsive. Plus there are occasionally memes. The python subreddit is pretty awesome too, I check for neat news and new libraries there frequently.
